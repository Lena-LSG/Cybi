# Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.

## Our Pledge
We are building tooling for small, welcoming online communities. Contributors and users should feel safe from harassment or discrimination regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity/expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity/orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Showing empathy toward other community members.
- Giving/accepting constructive feedback gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Assuming good intent when discussing ideas or code.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:
- Harassment, trolling, or disparaging comments.
- Publishing others’ private information.
- Sustained disruption of conversations or pull requests.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers (currently Lena Gibson) are responsible for clarifying actionable behaviour and may remove/edit/decline contributions or communication that violates this policy.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces—GitHub issues, pull requests, Discord channels, or any other project-controlled venues, as well as when individuals represent the project in public.

## Enforcement
To report violations, please use GitHub's “Report a vulnerability” / private advisory workflow or open a private discussion directed at the maintainers. Maintainers will investigate and respond within 5 business days. Reports will be kept private to the extent allowed by law.

## Attribution
This policy is adapted from the Contributor Covenant v2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). For answers to common questions, see https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.
