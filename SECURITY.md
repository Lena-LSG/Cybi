## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately so we can protect users' tokens and guilds.

1. Use GitHub's **"Report a vulnerability"** feature (Security → Advisories → Report vulnerability). This keeps your disclosure private.
2. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
   - Any mitigations you have already applied.
3. You will receive an acknowledgement within 3 business days.
4. We aim to provide a fix or remediation plan within 10 business days. If more time is required, we will keep you informed.

Do **not** disclose vulnerabilities publicly or via GitHub issues/PRs until a fix is released and coordinated disclosure is agreed upon.

Thank you for helping keep the community safe.
